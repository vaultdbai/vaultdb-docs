# Installing VaultDB

VaultDB is available as a Python package for macOS and Linux. You can visit our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/vaultdbai/vaultdb) or get the latest version from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

```bash
pip install vaultdbai
```

We highly recommend using **Python 3** for new projects. VaultDB does supports Python 3.7 and higher.

If you want to get a feel of VaultDB and the infrastructure behind it without having to
install anything locally, you can do in the browser by signing up for [a VaultDB
Hub](datahub.html).

## Upgrading VaultDB

If you have installed vaultdb previously, you can upgrade to the latest version with:

```bash
pip install --upgrade vaultdbai``
```
