# Welcome to VaultDB

==================

VaultDB is the Inprocess OLAP database that allows it's users to commit locally, push data to central location and merge from different streams. It is similar to Git and Github, work local share globaly. With Vaultdb your query results are merged from local and remote. We call it Data Inheritence. Set remote location to query remote data with local changes(Yes you can hide remote data from your queries with local delete statements).

Vaultdb also has built in Security Framework for use cases where data is controlled through roles and data fortresses for Governance, Risk and Controls. This will aloow control partners ability to control who sees what without external softwares and managers.

VaultDB is built on top of [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org)

## Coming Soon

1) Feature Engineering Views/Functions
2) Integrated Machine learning or Deterministic Models that can be pulled from remote and pushed and merged to remote
3) Model Deployment through Push
4) Production deployment through Merge
5) Model HUB
